The Project Code contains the following files:

1. data-pre-processing.ipynb
2. advanced-pre-processing.ipynb
3. average-word2vec.ipynb
4. base-price-prediction-model.ipynb
5. bitcoin-price-prediction-using-textblob.ipynb
6. bitcoin-price-prediction-using-vader.ipynb
7. bitcoin-price-prediction-using-roBERTa.ipynb
8. bitcoin-price-prediction-using-flair.ipynb


Dataset:
There are two Datasets asscociated with the project:

1. Bitcoin Data
Already provided in the Code folder. 

2. Tweet Data: Sourced from Kaggle.
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/bitcoin-tweets-16m-tweets-with-sentiment-tagged


It is recommended to export the .ipynb code files to Kaggle and run them there with the datasets,
as they are available on kaggle only.
